  conductor:
    # The Conductor container does the heavy lifting, and provides a portable
    # Python runtime for building your target containers. It should be derived
    # from the same distribution as you're building your target containers with.
    base: ubuntu:xenial
    # roles_path:   # Specify a local path containing Ansible roles
    # volumes:      # Provide a list of volumes to mount
    # environment:  # List or mapping of environment variables

  # Set the name of the project. Defaults to basename of the project directory.
  # For built services, concatenated with service name to form the built image name.
  project_name: python36-and-jupyter

  # The deployment_output_path is mounted to the Conductor container, and the 
  # `run` and `deployment` commands then write generated Ansible playbooks to it.

services:
  # Add your containers here, specifying the base image you want to build from.
  # To use this example, uncomment it and delete the curly braces after services key.
